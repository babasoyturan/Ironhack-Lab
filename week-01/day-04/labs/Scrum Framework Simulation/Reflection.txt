Scrum practices strongly support DevOps principles by fostering collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. In Scrum, cross-functional teams work together in short sprints, which aligns well with DevOps’ emphasis on breaking down silos between development and operations. Daily stand-ups and sprint reviews encourage frequent communication and rapid feedback, helping teams detect and resolve issues early—similar to continuous integration and continuous delivery practices in DevOps. The focus on delivering a potentially shippable increment each sprint promotes automation, testing, and deployment readiness, all core DevOps principles. Additionally, retrospectives reinforce a culture of learning and process optimization, which mirrors DevOps’ commitment to continuous improvement and operational excellence.
